# Election_Analysis
**Module 4 - Python**
## Overview of Election Audit: 
The purpose of this was to help Seth and Tom submit the election audit results to the election commission. We needed to breakdown the details of each section and numbers of each of these sections for a clean and clear result.

## Election-Audit Results: 
### County Votes:
* Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)
* Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
* Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)

### Largest County Turnout:
* Denver

### Candidate:
* Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
* Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
* Raymon Aanthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)

### Winner:
* Daina DeGette

## How many votes were cast in this congressional election?

**Total Votes: 369,712**

Please see the results of the election breakdown below.

As you can see Denver County had the largest County Turnout and also had the largest number and percentage of votes.

Diana DeGette won the race with 272,892 winning votes and a winning percentage of 73.8% votes.

This script can be used in any selection as long as the data is collected correctly. This is a clean and simple way to read and understand the data. This scrpit can also be used to provide the Smallest County Turnout instead of the Largest County Turnout like we provided. Instead of the Winner of the election we could also use this to provide the loser and the runner up.
